## Full Description (Tell us about your project)

B4AE (Beyond For All Encryption) is an open-source, quantum-resistant secure communication protocol built in Rust. It goes beyond traditional E2EE by combining:

- Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber-1024, Dilithium5) with hybrid X25519/Ed25519
- Metadata protection against traffic analysis
- Optional ELARA transport for UDP, NAT traversal
- Cross-platform support (desktop, mobile, web via WASM)

We are seeking fiscal sponsorship to:
- Fund security audits and formal verification
- Support infrastructure and CI/CD
- Promote adoption in privacy-critical applications

## Community (Optional)

B4AE is developed by open-source contributors focused on post-quantum cryptography and privacy-preserving communication. The project includes formal specifications (TLA+, Coq), security audits, and bindings for Android, C FFI, and WASM.
