**Subject:** B4AE — Quantum-Safe Transport for [Company] [Use Case]

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from the B4AE project — we've built a **drop-in quantum-safe transport layer** that integrates with existing secure messaging and RPC stacks (Signal-style, Matrix, MQTT, gRPC).

**Why it matters now:** NIST has standardized post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, Dilithium). B4AE implements these alongside metadata protection and enterprise compliance features (AuditSink, key rotation, GDPR/HIPAA mapping).

We're looking for **3 pilot partners** to integrate B4AE and provide feedback. In exchange:
- Early access & prioritized support
- Case study / testimonial opportunity
- Input on enterprise feature roadmap

**What we need:** A technical champion (CTO, Security Lead) for a 4–8 week pilot.

Would [Company] be interested in exploring a pilot? Happy to schedule a 30-min technical overview.

Best,  
[Your name]  
[B4AE / Contact]
